# =============================================================================
# browser.R -- opening an application where it can actually be used.
#
# THE PROBLEM
#   `shiny::runApp(launch.browser = TRUE)` ends in `utils::browseURL()`, which
#   goes through `options("browser")`. Inside RStudio that option is REPLACED by
#   a handler that keeps a localhost URL inside the IDE, so the application
#   lands in the Viewer pane -- a few hundred pixels wide, with no address bar,
#   no second tab and a JavaScript engine that is not the one the interface was
#   built against. Asking for a browser and getting a pane is not a preference
#   issue: a leaflet map or a plotly figure in that pane is unusable.
#
# THE FIX, AND WHY IT IS LOOKED UP RATHER THAN ASSUMED
#   RStudio exposes its own "external window" handler. It is fetched BY NAME
#   from `tools:rstudio`, and every failure -- not in RStudio, name gone in a
#   future version, environment not attached -- falls back to `browseURL()`.
#   A launcher must never abort because an internal name of another program
#   moved.
#
# The same three functions exist, identically, in the other two packages.
# Three packages, one behaviour, and no cross-dependency for six lines.
# =============================================================================
