#' Diameter of a point cloud: the distance between its two most distant points
#'
#' The largest Euclidean distance between any two points of a planar cloud.
#' Its purpose in this package is to be a **denominator**: a distance read off
#' an ordination -- a specimen to its species centroid, a centroid to a
#' reference point -- is in score units, which are arbitrary in magnitude and
#' depend on the axis pair displayed, so the number is uninterpretable on its
#' own. Divided by the diameter of the cloud it is read against, it becomes a
#' share of the total spread of that cloud: "this individual sits 7% of the
#' FISHMORPH morphospace away from its species' mean" is a statement a reader
#' can weigh, and it is comparable between axis pairs and between campaigns.
#'
#' @section Why the convex hull:
#' The two most distant points of a cloud are necessarily vertices of its
#' convex hull -- a point strictly inside the hull is closer to every other
#' point than some vertex is -- so the search can be restricted to the hull
#' without approximation. This matters: the FISHMORPH reference holds ~9,500
#' species, whose full pairwise distance matrix is ~45 million values (several
#' hundred megabytes), while its hull has a few dozen vertices. The result is
#' exact, not a sample.
#'
#' @param x Either a numeric vector of first coordinates, or a two-column
#'   matrix / data.frame of coordinates (in which case `y` is left `NULL`).
#' @param y Numeric vector of second coordinates, the same length as `x`, when
#'   `x` is a vector.
#'
#' @return A single numeric value, the maximum distance between two points.
#'   `NA_real_` when fewer than two points are finite, so that a caller
#'   dividing by it produces `NA` rather than a spurious number.
#'
#' @seealso [plotly_fishmorph()] and [project_fishmorph()], which use it to
#'   express tooltip distances as a percentage of the reference cloud's
#'   diameter; [trait_space()]
