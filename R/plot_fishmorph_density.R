#' Density curves of the FISHMORPH space, per functional axis and per ratio
#'
#' For a projection built by [project_fishmorph()], draws a panel of kernel
#' density curves for every requested variable -- each functional (PCA) axis
#' and each morphological ratio -- comparing the whole FISHMORPH reference
#' database (a filled grey curve) with each focal species (a coloured curve).
#' This is the one-dimensional, marginal complement to the two-dimensional
#' ordination drawn by [plot.intrait_fishmorph_projection()]: rather than
#' showing where a species' intraspecific trait variation (ITV) sits in the
#' morphospace as a whole, it shows, variable by variable, how the spread of
#' the projected individuals compares with the global distribution along that
#' single axis or ratio -- e.g. whether a species occupies the centre or a
#' tail of the reference, and how wide its ITV is relative to the global
#' range.
#'
#' Each curve is drawn on a shared percentage axis: its density is rescaled to
#' a percentage of its *own* maximum (peak = 100%). Raw kernel densities
#' integrate to 1, so a species with a narrow, tightly-clustered ITV would
#' otherwise appear as a tall spike and a widely-spread one as a low, flat
#' curve, making the two hard to compare on the same axis. Normalising each to
#' its own peak puts every species and the reference on the same 0-100% height,
#' so the eye compares *where* each distribution sits and *how wide* it is
#' rather than a height that merely reflects its spread.
#'
#' Axis panels use the projected scores: the reference curve is the reference
#' species' own scores on that component (`x$global_scores_all`) and each
#' focal species' curve is its projected specimens' scores
#' (`x$scores_all`). Ratio panels use the trait values on the analysis scale
#' (the `log10(x + 1)` scale when [project_fishmorph()] was called with
#' `log_transform = TRUE`): the reference curve is `x$reference_traits` and
#' each focal species' curve is its specimens' traits (`x$specimen_traits`),
#' so the two are always on the same, directly comparable scale. Species
#' colours are the same session-stable colours used by
#' [plot.intrait_fishmorph_projection()], so a species keeps one colour
#' across both figures.
#'
#' @param x An object of class `"intrait_fishmorph_projection"`, from
#'   [project_fishmorph()].
#' @param what Character, which variables to draw: `"both"` (default) draws
#'   the requested axes followed by the requested ratios, `"axes"` only the
#'   functional axes, `"ratios"` only the morphological ratios.
#' @param axes Integer vector, which principal-component axes to draw density
#'   panels for (ignored when `what = "ratios"`). `NULL` (default) uses the
#'   two axes retained for plotting by the projection (`x$axes`); pass e.g.
#'   `1:4` to inspect further components. Each must be within the number of
#'   components available.
#' @param traits Character vector, which ratios to draw density panels for
#'   (ignored when `what = "axes"`). `NULL` (default) uses every trait in the
#'   space (`x$traits`); pass a subset to restrict the figure. Unknown trait
#'   names are reported with an error.
#' @param select_species Optional character vector: draw only these focal
#'   species' curves (matched against the projection's groups). The grey
#'   reference curve is always the full reference database, unaffected by this
#'   filter. `NULL` (default) draws every projected species.
#' @param select_specimens Optional character vector: restrict the focal
#'   curves to these specimen identifiers (matched against the score row
#'   names). Combined with `select_species` by intersection. `NULL` (default)
#'   keeps them all.
#' @param reference_col Colour of the FISHMORPH reference curve (and its fill).
#'   Defaults to `"grey55"`.
#' @param reference_fill Logical, shade the area under the reference curve (in
#'   a translucent `reference_col`) as well as drawing its outline, so the
#'   global distribution reads as a background band beneath the coloured
#'   species curves. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param fill_alpha Numeric in `[0, 1]`, opacity of the reference fill (when
#'   `reference_fill = TRUE`). Defaults to `0.35`.
#' @param species_fill Logical, shade the area under each focal species' curve
#'   in a translucent version of that species' colour (as well as drawing the
#'   curve outline), so the species distributions read as filled bands rather
#'   than bare lines. The transparency lets overlapping species remain
#'   distinguishable where their distributions cross. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param species_fill_alpha Numeric in `[0, 1]`, opacity of the species fills
#'   (when `species_fill = TRUE`). Kept lighter than `fill_alpha` by default
#'   because several species fills can overlap in one panel. Defaults to `0.2`.
#' @param rug Logical, add a rug of the individual focal specimens' values
#'   along the axis of each panel, coloured by species, so small samples (for
#'   which a density curve is only indicative, or is omitted entirely) still
#'   show where their specimens fall. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param lwd Numeric, line width of the species curves (the reference curve is
#'   drawn one step heavier). Defaults to `1.8`.
#' @param legend Logical, draw a shared species legend in its own panel after
#'   the variable panels. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param legend_italic Logical, italicise the species names in the legend (as
#'   binomials). Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param abbreviate_species Logical, abbreviate the genus in the legend
#'   (e.g. `"Squalius cephalus"` becomes `"S. cephalus"`). Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param mfrow Optional integer vector `c(nrow, ncol)` giving the panel grid.
#'   `NULL` (default) chooses a near-square layout that fits every variable
#'   panel plus the legend panel.
#' @param ... Further graphical parameters passed to each panel's
#'   [graphics::plot()] call (e.g. `cex.main`).
#'
#' @return Invisibly returns a list with one element per drawn variable, each
#'   itself a list of the [stats::density()] objects actually computed
#'   (`reference`, and one per species that had enough points), so the
#'   densities can be reused or redrawn. Called for its side effect of drawing
#'   the figure.
