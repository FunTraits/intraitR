#' Colour with an alpha channel, in the CSS notation plotly expects
#'
#' plotly's JSON schema takes colours as CSS strings and has no separate
#' opacity field for a fill (`fillcolor`) or a marker outline, so an R colour
#' name / hex code plus an alpha has to be flattened into a single
#' `"rgba(r, g, b, a)"` string. [grDevices::adjustcolor()] would instead
#' return an 8-digit hex (`"#RRGGBBAA"`), which older plotly.js builds ignore
#' silently -- the alpha is dropped and translucent hulls come out opaque, so
#' the conversion is done explicitly here.
#'
#' @param col A single R colour (name or hex).
#' @param alpha Numeric in `[0, 1]`, the opacity.
#' @return A length-1 character string, e.g. `"rgba(78, 121, 167, 0.2)"`.
#' @noRd
.rgba <- function(col, alpha = 1) {
  rgb <- grDevices::col2rgb(col)[, 1]
  sprintf("rgba(%d, %d, %d, %s)", rgb[[1]], rgb[[2]], rgb[[3]],
          format(alpha, digits = 3))
}

#' plotly colorscale from a vector of colours (low to high)
#'
#' plotly expects a colorscale as a list of `list(fraction, colour)` pairs
#' with fractions spanning `[0, 1]`, rather than the plain colour vector
#' [graphics::image()] takes as `col`. This converts the package's
#' density-heatmap ramp (see `.plot_ordination()`) into that form so the
#' static and interactive figures share one palette.
#'
#' @param cols Character vector of colours, low density first.
#' @return A list of two-element lists, ready for a plotly `colorscale`.
#' @noRd
.plotly_colorscale <- function(cols) {
  n <- length(cols)
  if (n == 1) return(list(list(0, cols[1]), list(1, cols[1])))
  lapply(seq_len(n), function(i) list((i - 1) / (n - 1), cols[i]))
}

#' Diameter of a planar point cloud (largest distance between two points)
#'
#' The scale a distance read off an ordination is expressed against. A distance
#' in score units is uninterpretable on its own -- it depends on the traits,
#' on the standardisation and on which components are displayed -- whereas the
#' same distance as a fraction of the largest distance the cloud contains is a
#' dimensionless share of the occupied space, comparable between axis pairs and
#' between figures.
#'
#' The diameter of a planar set is attained by two vertices of its convex hull
#' (any interior or edge point can be pushed outwards along the segment joining
#' the pair), so the quadratic search is run on the hull only. For the ~9,500
#' FISHMORPH species the hull holds a few dozen vertices, which turns a 45
#' million pair computation into a few hundred.
#'
#' @param x,y Numeric vectors of coordinates. Non-finite pairs are dropped.
#' @return A single number, the largest Euclidean distance between two points,
#'   or `NA_real_` when fewer than two distinct points remain (a scale of zero
#'   is not a usable denominator either).
#' @noRd
.cloud_diameter <- function(x, y) {
  ok <- is.finite(x) & is.finite(y)
  x <- x[ok]; y <- y[ok]
  n <- length(x)
  if (n < 2) return(NA_real_)
  # chull() can fail on degenerate input (all points equal, perfectly
  # collinear); falling back to the full set keeps the answer exact, and the
  # cases where it fails are the small ones.
  h <- if (n > 3) tryCatch(grDevices::chull(x, y),
                           error = function(e) seq_len(n)) else seq_len(n)
  if (length(h) < 2) return(NA_real_)
  d <- max(stats::dist(cbind(x[h], y[h])))
  if (!is.finite(d) || d <= 0) return(NA_real_)

#' Interactive FISHMORPH projection plot (plotly)
#'
#' The interactive counterpart of [plot.intrait_fishmorph_projection()]:
#' the same figure -- the reference database as a kernel-density heatmap
#' and/or point cloud, with the projected specimens on top of it, grouped by
#' species -- rendered as a **plotly** htmlwidget instead of a base-graphics
#' device. What the static plot cannot do, and what this is for, is
#' *identifying* points: a ~9,000-species morphospace with a few hundred
#' projected individuals in it has no room for labels, so hovering is the
#' only practical way to ask which specimen (and which trait values) sits at
#' a given position. The legend is clickable, so single species can be
#' isolated from an overplotted cloud without recomputing anything, and the
#' plot can be zoomed into a dense region.
#'
#' @section What is drawn, and in which order:
#' Traces are added back to front: the reference density heatmap and its
#' highest-density-region contour lines, the reference point cloud, the
#' per-species geometry (`style`), the focal species' own reference-database
#' points (`itv_reference`), then the projected specimens. Every trace
#' belonging to one species shares a plotly `legendgroup`, so a click on that
#' species in the legend hides or shows its points *and* its hull/ellipse
#' together (double-click isolates it). The reference layers are outside any
#' legend group and stay visible throughout, since they are the frame of
#' reference the selection is read against.
#'
#' @section Hover information:
#' Each projected point reports its specimen identifier (the row name of the
#' projection's `scores`), its species and its coordinates on the two
#' displayed axes. Adding `hover_traits = TRUE` appends its nine FISHMORPH
#' ratios *on the analysis scale* (i.e. `log10(x + 1)` when
#' [project_fishmorph()] was called with `log_transform = TRUE`), taken from
#' `x$specimen_traits`, so the numbers in the tooltip are directly comparable
#' with the reference values that define the space rather than with the raw
#' ratios; they are off by default, and wrapped three per line when on,
#' because plotly does not wrap hover text and a nine-ratio line covers the
#' morphospace the point is being located in. A hull or
#' ellipse reports its species, its number of specimens and, when the
#' projection carries an [itv_proportion()] result, that species' share of
#' the global functional volume. Reference points report the reference
#' species' name when the projection carries labels (`x$global_species`).
#'
#' `hover_distances` (on by default) adds two numbers an ordination cannot be
#' read off by eye: how far a specimen sits from the centroid of its own
#' species -- its contribution to the intraspecific spread -- and how far it
#' sits from the single FISHMORPH morphotype of that species, i.e. the
#' individual the global database represents the whole species by. The second
#' is only shown when a reference point layer is actually drawn
#' (`reference_points` or `itv_reference`), since it is a distance to a point
#' the reader would otherwise not see; the `"spider"` centroid marker reports
#' that same distance for the species mean.
#'
#' Both are reported as a **percentage of the FISHMORPH span** -- the largest
#' distance between two reference species on the same two axes, i.e. the
#' diameter of the global morphospace -- with the value in score units in
#' brackets. A distance in score units is uninterpretable on its own, since it
#' depends on the traits, on the standardisation and on which components are
#' displayed; the same distance as a share of the whole occupied range is
#' dimensionless and can be compared between axis pairs, species and
#' campaigns. They remain plain Euclidean distances **on the two displayed
#' axes**: they are the distances the figure shows (`equal_aspect = TRUE` is
#' what makes them readable), they change when `axes` changes, and they are not
#' distances in the full nine-trait space.
#'
#' @param x An object of class `"intrait_fishmorph_projection"`, from
#'   [project_fishmorph()].
#' @param style Character, the per-species (foreground) geometry: `"hull"`
#'   (default; convex hull = the ITV footprint), `"spider"` (dispersion
#'   ellipse plus spokes to the centroid), `"density"` (kernel-density
#'   contour of the projected specimens), or `"points"` (no per-group
#'   geometry). As in the static method, this is independent of
#'   `reference_density`, which controls the *background* layer.
#' @param axes Integer vector of length 2, which principal components to
#'   display. `NULL` (default) uses the two axes the projection was built to
#'   plot (`x$axes`); any other pair is taken from the all-component scores
#'   (`x$scores_all`, `x$global_scores_all`) with no refitting, so exploring
#'   further components costs nothing and cannot move the space.
#' @param reference_density Logical, draw the reference database as a filled
#'   kernel-density heatmap (the same white-to-dark-red ramp as the static
#'   plot) with a few nested highest-density-region contour lines. Defaults
#'   to `TRUE`.
#' @param reference_points Logical, draw the reference species as a light
#'   background point cloud. Can be combined with `reference_density`.
#'   Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @param itv_reference Logical, mark the focal species' own entries in the
#'   reference database, coloured to match their species, so the single
#'   database morphotype can be compared with the spread of the projected
#'   individuals. Matching is case-insensitive and treats spaces and
#'   underscores as equivalent; species with no reference row are skipped
#'   with a warning. Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @param arrows Logical, overlay the trait loadings (`x$loadings`) as biplot
#'   arrows from the origin, with the trait name at each tip, turning the
#'   score plot into a PCA biplot. Drawn as plotly annotations, so they are
#'   part of the figure but carry no hover information. Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @param arrow_scale Numeric in `(0, 1]`, how far the longest loading arrow
#'   reaches, as a fraction of the distance from the origin to the nearest
#'   edge of the displayed region; all arrows share that one factor, so their
#'   relative lengths and directions are preserved. Loadings are unit-scaled
#'   vectors with no natural size in score units, so this is a display choice
#'   only. Defaults to `0.8`.
#' @param arrow_col Colour of the loading arrows and their labels. Defaults
#'   to `"grey20"`.
#' @param background Logical master switch: when `FALSE`, no reference layer
#'   of any kind is drawn (overrides `reference_density`,
#'   `reference_points`, `itv_reference`). Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param background_col Colour of the reference point cloud. Defaults to
#'   `"grey75"`.
#' @param density_probs Numeric vector of coverage probabilities for the
#'   heatmap's highest-density-region contour lines. Defaults to
#'   `c(0.25, 0.5, 0.99)`.
#' @param density_palette Optional character vector of colours for the
#'   heatmap gradient (low to high density). `NULL` (default) uses the
#'   package's white-to-dark-red ramp.
#' @param select_species,select_specimens Optional character vectors
#'   restricting *this figure* to a subset of the already-projected species
#'   or specimen identifiers, without recomputing the space (the reference
#'   background is unaffected). Combined by intersection. `NULL` (default)
#'   shows everything projected.
#' @param ellipse_level,density_level Coverage probabilities for the
#'   `"spider"` ellipse and the `"density"` contour respectively. Default
#'   `0.95`.
#' @param hover_traits Logical, add each specimen's trait values (on the
#'   analysis scale) to its tooltip. Defaults to `FALSE`: nine ratios on one
#'   line produce a tooltip wider than the plotting region, which hides the
#'   very morphospace the point is being located in. When `TRUE` the values
#'   are wrapped three per line to keep the box narrow.
#' @param hover_distances Logical, add to each specimen's tooltip its
#'   Euclidean distance (on the two displayed axes, as a percentage of the
#'   largest distance between two reference species and in score units) to the
#'   centroid of its species and, when a reference point layer is drawn
#'   (`reference_points` or `itv_reference`), to its species' own FISHMORPH
#'   database point; the `"spider"` centroid marker then also reports its own
#'   distance to that point. The species is matched to the database with the
#'   rule `itv_reference` uses (case-insensitive, spaces and underscores
#'   equivalent) and the distance is omitted for a species the database does
#'   not contain. The centroid is that of the specimens *displayed*, so a
#'   `select_species` / `select_specimens` selection moves it. Defaults to
#'   `TRUE`.
#' @param hover_font_size Numeric, font size (in pixels) of the tooltip text.
#'   Defaults to `10`, smaller than plotly's own default, since a tooltip here
#'   carries an identifier and a species name rather than a single number.
#' @param point_size Numeric, marker size (in pixels) of the projected
#'   specimens. Defaults to `7`.
#' @param fill_alpha Numeric in `[0, 1]`, opacity of the per-species hull /
#'   ellipse / contour fill. Defaults to `0.2`, low enough that overlapping
#'   ITV footprints stay readable. Set to `0` for outlines only.
#' @param equal_aspect Logical, force one score unit on the horizontal axis to
#'   occupy the same number of pixels as one score unit on the vertical axis
#'   (plotly's `scaleanchor`). The two displayed components are in the same
#'   units, so an unequal aspect ratio silently distorts every distance, hull
#'   shape and loading direction read off the figure, and rescales them again
#'   at every zoom; the cost is that a low-variance PC2 then occupies only a
#'   thin horizontal band, as it should. Set to `FALSE` to reproduce the
#'   base-graphics method's behaviour, where each axis is stretched
#'   independently to fill the panel. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param legend Logical, show the (clickable) species legend. Defaults to
#'   `TRUE`.
#' @param legend_title Title above the legend. Defaults to `"Species"`.
#' @param legend_italic Logical, italicise the species names in the legend
#'   and tooltips (as binomials), using the HTML markup plotly renders.
#'   Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param abbreviate_species Logical, abbreviate the genus in the legend
#'   (e.g. `"Squalius cephalus"` becomes `"S. cephalus"`). Tooltips always
#'   carry the full name. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param webgl Logical, render the reference point cloud with WebGL
#'   (`"scattergl"`) rather than SVG. A ~9,000-point SVG trace makes the
#'   widget sluggish in a browser and slow to save; WebGL draws it on the GPU
#'   in one pass. Only the reference cloud is affected -- the specimens stay
#'   SVG so their markers and hover boxes render identically to a small
#'   figure. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#' @param title Optional plot title. `NULL` (default) builds one naming the
#'   space and the style, as the static method does.
#' @param width,height Optional widget dimensions in pixels, passed to
#'   [plotly::plot_ly()]. `NULL` (default) lets the container decide.
#'
#' @return A `plotly` htmlwidget (class `c("plotly", "htmlwidget")`). Printed
#'   at the console it opens in the RStudio Viewer or a browser; it can be
#'   embedded in an R Markdown / Quarto document, or written to a
#'   self-contained HTML file with `htmlwidgets::saveWidget()`. The widget's
#'   mode-bar camera button is configured to export SVG rather than PNG, so
#'   the figure taken out of an exploratory session is a vector graphic.
