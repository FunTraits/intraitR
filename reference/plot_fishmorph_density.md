# Density curves of the FISHMORPH space, per functional axis and per ratio

For a projection built by
[`project_fishmorph()`](https://funtraits.github.io/intraitR/reference/project_fishmorph.md),
draws a panel of kernel density curves for every requested variable –
each functional (PCA) axis and each morphological ratio – comparing the
whole FISHMORPH reference database (a filled grey curve) with each focal
species (a coloured curve). This is the one-dimensional, marginal
complement to the two-dimensional ordination drawn by
[`plot.intrait_fishmorph_projection()`](https://funtraits.github.io/intraitR/reference/project_fishmorph.md):
rather than showing where a species' intraspecific trait variation (ITV)
sits in the morphospace as a whole, it shows, variable by variable, how
the spread of the projected individuals compares with the global
distribution along that single axis or ratio – e.g. whether a species
occupies the centre or a tail of the reference, and how wide its ITV is
relative to the global range.

## Usage

``` r
plot_fishmorph_density(
  x,
  what = c("both", "axes", "ratios"),
  axes = NULL,
  traits = NULL,
  select_species = NULL,
  select_specimens = NULL,
  reference_col = "grey55",
  reference_fill = TRUE,
  fill_alpha = 0.35,
  species_fill = TRUE,
  species_fill_alpha = 0.2,
  rug = TRUE,
  lwd = 1.8,
  legend = TRUE,
  legend_italic = TRUE,
  abbreviate_species = TRUE,
  mfrow = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An object of class `"intrait_fishmorph_projection"`, from
  [`project_fishmorph()`](https://funtraits.github.io/intraitR/reference/project_fishmorph.md).

- what:

  Character, which variables to draw: `"both"` (default) draws the
  requested axes followed by the requested ratios, `"axes"` only the
  functional axes, `"ratios"` only the morphological ratios.

- axes:

  Integer vector, which principal-component axes to draw density panels
  for (ignored when `what = "ratios"`). `NULL` (default) uses the two
  axes retained for plotting by the projection (`x$axes`); pass e.g.
  `1:4` to inspect further components. Each must be within the number of
  components available.

- traits:

  Character vector, which ratios to draw density panels for (ignored
  when `what = "axes"`). `NULL` (default) uses every trait in the space
  (`x$traits`); pass a subset to restrict the figure. Unknown trait
  names are reported with an error.

- select_species:

  Optional character vector: draw only these focal species' curves
  (matched against the projection's groups). The grey reference curve is
  always the full reference database, unaffected by this filter. `NULL`
  (default) draws every projected species.

- select_specimens:

  Optional character vector: restrict the focal curves to these specimen
  identifiers (matched against the score row names). Combined with
  `select_species` by intersection. `NULL` (default) keeps them all.

- reference_col:

  Colour of the FISHMORPH reference curve (and its fill). Defaults to
  `"grey55"`.

- reference_fill:

  Logical, shade the area under the reference curve (in a translucent
  `reference_col`) as well as drawing its outline, so the global
  distribution reads as a background band beneath the coloured species
  curves. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- fill_alpha:

  Numeric in `[0, 1]`, opacity of the reference fill (when
  `reference_fill = TRUE`). Defaults to `0.35`.

- species_fill:

  Logical, shade the area under each focal species' curve in a
  translucent version of that species' colour (as well as drawing the
  curve outline), so the species distributions read as filled bands
  rather than bare lines. The transparency lets overlapping species
  remain distinguishable where their distributions cross. Defaults to
  `TRUE`.

- species_fill_alpha:

  Numeric in `[0, 1]`, opacity of the species fills (when
  `species_fill = TRUE`). Kept lighter than `fill_alpha` by default
  because several species fills can overlap in one panel. Defaults to
  `0.2`.

- rug:

  Logical, add a rug of the individual focal specimens' values along the
  axis of each panel, coloured by species, so small samples (for which a
  density curve is only indicative, or is omitted entirely) still show
  where their specimens fall. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- lwd:

  Numeric, line width of the species curves (the reference curve is
  drawn one step heavier). Defaults to `1.8`.

- legend:

  Logical, draw a shared species legend in its own panel after the
  variable panels. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- legend_italic:

  Logical, italicise the species names in the legend (as binomials).
  Defaults to `TRUE`.

- abbreviate_species:

  Logical, abbreviate the genus in the legend (e.g.
  `"Squalius cephalus"` becomes `"S. cephalus"`). Defaults to `TRUE`.

- mfrow:

  Optional integer vector `c(nrow, ncol)` giving the panel grid. `NULL`
  (default) chooses a near-square layout that fits every variable panel
  plus the legend panel.

- ...:

  Further graphical parameters passed to each panel's
  [`graphics::plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)
  call (e.g. `cex.main`).

## Value

Invisibly returns a list with one element per drawn variable, each
itself a list of the
[`stats::density()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/density.html) objects
actually computed (`reference`, and one per species that had enough
points), so the densities can be reused or redrawn. Called for its side
effect of drawing the figure.

## Details

Each curve is drawn on a shared percentage axis: its density is rescaled
to a percentage of its *own* maximum (peak = 100%). Raw kernel densities
integrate to 1, so a species with a narrow, tightly-clustered ITV would
otherwise appear as a tall spike and a widely-spread one as a low, flat
curve, making the two hard to compare on the same axis. Normalising each
to its own peak puts every species and the reference on the same 0-100%
height, so the eye compares *where* each distribution sits and *how
wide* it is rather than a height that merely reflects its spread.

Axis panels use the projected scores: the reference curve is the
reference species' own scores on that component (`x$global_scores_all`)
and each focal species' curve is its projected specimens' scores
(`x$scores_all`). Ratio panels use the trait values on the analysis
scale (the `log10(x + 1)` scale when
[`project_fishmorph()`](https://funtraits.github.io/intraitR/reference/project_fishmorph.md)
was called with `log_transform = TRUE`): the reference curve is
`x$reference_traits` and each focal species' curve is its specimens'
traits (`x$specimen_traits`), so the two are always on the same,
directly comparable scale. Species colours are the same session-stable
colours used by
[`plot.intrait_fishmorph_projection()`](https://funtraits.github.io/intraitR/reference/project_fishmorph.md),
so a species keeps one colour across both figures.

#> Warning: 23 specimen(s) have a zero-length or missing scale bar (points 20-21); their segments will be NA. See fishmorph_ratios()'s `landmarks` argument to still recover the 9 unitless ratios for these specimens directly from pixel-space distances.
#> na_action = "omit": removing 293 row(s) out of 1036 with missing values.
